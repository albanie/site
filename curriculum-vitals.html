    <h5>Personal</h5>

    <p>About six foot tall, in the morning. Star sign: Cancer, so I’m sensitive 
    to the feelings of others and have a vivid imagination, but I can also seem 
    moody in stressful situations, especially around a Sagittarius. My shoe 
    size is 11 UK (or 13 US), but my feet are quite wide, so I struggle to find 
    shoes in standard retailers such as Clarks.</p>


    <h5>Academic History</h5>

    <p>I was once described as “quite clever”, by my tutor, and at the 
    precocious age of just 20, almost beat my younger brother at a game of 
    chess. He is however, by his own admission, not very good.</p>

    <p>By the age of 14, I could read. In English, mainly, but also in a 
    language I made up in my head. It had only one vowel, <em>o</em>, so 
    difficult pronunciation was also a skill I got to grips with early.</p>

    <h5>Employment History</h5>

    <p>Shortly after my voice had dropped, I was out on the farmland as a 
    beater in the hunt. I’m widely feared by pheasants and foxes near 
    Shelfanger, a metropolis of commerce and culture in Norfolk (UK). 
    From these experiences, I have developed the skills necessary to use 
    violence and loud shouting to resolve confrontation.</p>

    <p>As soon as I could taste the difference between Adnams Southworld 
    Bitter and Adnams Broadside, I embarked on my next major career move, 
    spending three and a half weeks working on a worm farm (selecting the 
    juiciest and finest worms to be used as bait). This allowed me to develop 
    an appreciation for quality, technical agricultural practice, and the 
    colour of a healthy worm. </p>

    <p>My next opportunity for gainful employment arose out in the colonies 
    at an insurance consultancy firm. This exposed me to a style of refined 
    business etiquette that I had previously been unaccustomed to in Norfolk. 
    <em>Skill acquired:</em> The ability to pour a glass of rum <em>under 
      pressure</em>.</p>

    <p>I followed this up with a trip to Asia, where I taught literally tens 
    of children the nuances of the English language. They called me “Shan Mu” 
    (<em>mountain berry</em>). This name arose from an alcohol fuelled argument 
    over the definition of a berry, in a bar in down town Shanghai. The 
    observant linguist will notice the phonetic similarity to my Christian 
    forename, Samuel.</p>

    <p>Finally, to continue my cultural diversification, I took a job in a 
    steel factory, thirty seven minutes and fifteen seconds (on a road bike, 
    into a mild headwind, no precipitation, mild cloud cover) away from my 
    home. Any prospective employer should therefore note that I am comfortable 
    with the harsh realities of commuting. Here, I learned how keep up the 
    appearance of work in front of factory supervisors, whilst contributing 
    the A.M (<em>absolute minimum</em>), towards efficiency and production.  
    I also learned to develop my considerable linguistic skills, and can 
    count to seventeen fluently in Polish. </p>

    <h5>Other Interests And Achievements</h5>

    <p>Most people struggle to name their proudest achievement. As this CV 
    shows, if you are looking for a member of the “most” category, I’m not 
    the candidate for you. If you’re looking for exceptional, look no further.
    Proudest achievement:  My Yahtzee record against my Grandmother:</p>
      <p>Wins 14, Losses 3.</p>
    </p>

    <p>I’m also a keen sportsman. I played as the second ranked player in the 
    “Attleborough Allstars” B team, in the Norfolk Table Tennis Association, 
    Third Division.  At my final school sportsday, I came second in the 800m. 
    Honesty and integrity, are however, also qualities that come easily to me, 
    and it is worth noting that several high performing athletes were ill at 
    the time, having contracted food poisoning the night before at my birthday 
    party. I cooked the chicken.</p>

    <h5>Poetry</h5>

    <p>Few CVs include a poetry section. 
    <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
    
    <p>The following piece was inspired by real life experiences and was 
    submitted to a poetry competition in 2016 
    <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>:

        The deadline approaches.<br>
      </em>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h5>Other Employment</h5>

    <p><strong>Paper round</strong>, stretching from house 34, Lewis Lane, 
    Diss (reads the Telegraph), to 47, Appletetre Lane, Diss (reads the sun, 
    has a Doberman called Spike).</p>

    <p>Worked as a <em>tyre consultant</em> in T.H Tyre Garage, Diss for three 
    months, before legal complications arose regarding age of employment.</p>

    <h5>Referees</h5>

    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Webb">Howard Webb</a> 
        I’ve always felt that he was a little quick to hand out a first yellow, 
        but his firm but fair approach to diving in and around the penalty 
        area won him respect amongst fans and club management the world over.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Pezzotta">
          Sergio Pezzotta</a> Never afraid of controversy, or intimidated 
        by the big names in the dug outs, his favourite colour was red. He 
        tended to feel that eleven men on each team made the beautiful game 
        a little too crowded.</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierluigi_Collina">
          Pierluigi Collina</a> One of the games greatest. He made up for a 
        lack of hair with an abundance of wisdom, and great people skills. 
        His prominent eyeballs also gave him a physiological advantage over 
        his colleagues, leaving many to question whether he was entirely 
        human.</li>

    <sup id="fn1">1. Robert Pinksy has a 
    <a href="http://www.bu.edu/english/files/2010/04/Pinsky-11.5.13.pdf">CV</a>
      three pages long. It does not contain a single poem. The 
      former Poet Laureate of the United States does have a section
      entitled <em>Poetry</em>.  However, rather than delighting the reader 
      with his poems right then and there <em>"mid-CV"</em> and 
      sacrificing valuable page space for his art, he simply lists them by 
      name, together with the names of the numerous rewards that they have 
      received.

          <p>If, somehow, you made it through all of the above and are 
          <em>still</em> interested in employing me, drop me an email 
          (albanie at robots.ox.ac.uk). If required, I can provide a "real" 
          CV. It's fairly underwhelming.</p>
